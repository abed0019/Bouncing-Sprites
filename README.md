Server modified to handle multiple clients, in parallel, using multithreading.

In the first part of this exercise, I compiled and linked a small C++ client and server to become familiar
with compiling and linking outside the Java environment. Then I used my knowledge of Java syntax to
make a small change to the C++ server, and recompiled it. 

In the second part of this exercise I worked with client and server programs written in Java, but like
the C++ programs from the first part. I made the same change to the Java server as I made to the
C++ server, and then I went even further to use my knowledge of Java Multithreading to make the
Java server multithreaded.
